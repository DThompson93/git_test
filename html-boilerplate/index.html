    <p>It's January 2024, I'm on a paid sabbatical from my job and I'm dreading going back.</p>
    <p><strong>BUT</strong>, I have few skills, at least that I'm aware of, that can help me with getting out of the <em>hospitality</em> industry. What do I do?</p>
    <h4>I'll learn how to code!</h4>
    <p>So from <strong>February 2024</strong>, I began learning to code.</p>
    <p>Using <em>The Odin Project</em> (<strong><em>TOP</em></strong>), I've begun learning HTML, hence this webpage. It's giving me the chance to practice using different beginner tags like the several </p>
        <h4 class="titles">header</h4> 
        <p>tags and the <i>paragraph </i> tag, on top of the bold and italic tags!</p>
        <p>I may also <em>Show My Work</em> on <b>Youtube</b> or some other platform too. Who knows!</p>

    <!-- em stands for embellish - this makes the text italic. The use of i is for foreign words or idiomatic phrases, technical terms, ship names, thoughts etc. -->
    <!-- strong makes the text bold. Don't use b it doesn't convey extra importance, emphasis, alternate voice or mood. -->
